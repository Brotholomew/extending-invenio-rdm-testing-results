This phenomenon has been discerned as the principal source of error in the current version of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, as it contradicts the assumption that soil backscatter increases monotonically with soil moisture content. This happens because, in dry soil conditions, the presence of stones, rocks, or distinct soil layers can disrupt this expected relationship. At TU Wien, we have developed one statistical (P_ano) and two physically based indicators (P_sub, S_sub) that show the widespread occurrence of subsurface scattering not only in desert regions but also in more humid climates with distinct dry seasons. These indicators offer a means to identify subsurface scattering effects, enabling users of H SAF ASCAT soil moisture data to mask such effects.

This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are excluded.

This phenomenon has been discerned as the principal source of error in the current version of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, as it contradicts the assumption that soil backscatter increases monotonically with soil moisture content. This happens because, in dry soil conditions, the presence of stones, rocks, or distinct soil layers can disrupt this expected relationship. At TU Wien, we have developed one statistical (P_ano) and two physically based indicators (P_sub, S_sub) that show the widespread occurrence of subsurface scattering not only in desert regions but also in more humid climates with distinct dry seasons. These indicators offer a means to identify subsurface scattering effects, enabling users of H SAF ASCAT soil moisture data to mask such effects. By selecting one of the provided indicators and setting a suitable threshold, users can tailor the masking process to their specific needs. As a baseline, we recommend using the monthly subsurface scattering mask included here in its dedicated file.</p><p>We encourage the user community to leverage this data record to enhance the design of ASCAT soil moisture validation and application experiments. Moreover, this resource invites a reevaluation of conclusions drawn from earlier ASCAT studies and presents an opportunity to extend insights to other active microwave sensors operating at lower microwave frequencies (S-, L-, and P-band).</p><h2>Dataset Record</h2><h3>ASCAT Mask Results</h3><p>This file contains the a mask recommended for ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, designed to address various conditions that can render ASCAT soil moisture data unreliable. These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1. This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are excluded. Note that the subsurface scattering mask represents mean monthly conditions over the years 2007 to 2021, i.e. the behavior in single years may deviate from these conditions.</p><p>The interpretation of values is as follows:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied, signifying that the soil moisture retrieval is considered reliable</li><li>1: indicates the application of the mask, implying that the soil moisture retrieval may not be reliable</li></ul><h3>ERA5-Land Data Analysis</h3><p>For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of subsurface scattering or desiring to generate customized masks utilizing the provided indicators, this file offers insights into ASCAT backscatter and surface soil moisture in combination with ERA5-Land soil moisture as well as ancillary information. The underlying data spans from 2007 to 2021 and is again gridded to the 12.5 km WARP5 grid. Within this file, users can access the following information:</p><p><strong>Subsurface scattering indicators:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>P_ano</strong> - Probability of the occurrence of backscatter anomalies, depicts how frequently the ASCAT backscatter data exhibit anomalies</li><li><strong>P_ano_MM</strong> - P_ano calculated on a monthly basis</li><li><strong>P_sub</strong> - Probability of detecting subsurface scattering, derived from a physically based method that compares the goodness of fit of two backscatter models</li><li><strong>S_sub </strong>- Subsurface scattering signal strength, displays the signal range of the subsurface scattering<br>term from completely dry to wet conditions</li></ul><p><strong>Correlations before and after masking:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>R_unmasked</strong> - Pearson correlation coefficient between ASCAT surface soil moisture and ERA5-Land soil moisture with no mask applied</li><li><strong>R_masked</strong> - Pearson correlation after applying the mask provided in the file above</li></ul><p><strong>Selected specific masks:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>cold_mask </strong>- Frozen soil and snow cover mask using ASCAT confidence flag (bit 1), ERA5-Land soil temperature (\u2264 2 \u00b0C) and snow depth data (&gt; 0 mm after averaging with a sliding window of 31 days)</li><li><strong>veg_mask </strong>- Dense vegetation mask based on ASCAT confidence flags (bits 4 and 5) and Copernicus Global Land Monitoring service (CGLS) leaf area index (LAI) data (LAI &gt; 3)</li><li><strong>wet_mask </strong>- Wetland mask using Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), land cover information, and ASCAT confidence flag</li><li><strong>subsurface_mask </strong>- Subsurface scattering mask based on monthly P_ano data (P_ano &gt; 0.1) if threshold is exceeded for more than nine months</li></ul><p>Again, the values can be interpreted in the following way:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied</li><li>1: indicates the application of the corresponding mask</li></ul><p>Some pixels exhibit no values, even with none of the provided masks applied.

This phenomenon has been discerned as the principal source of error in the current version of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, as it contradicts the assumption that soil backscatter increases monotonically with soil moisture content. This happens because, in dry soil conditions, the presence of stones, rocks, or distinct soil layers can disrupt this expected relationship. At TU Wien, we have developed one statistical (P_ano) and two physically based indicators (P_sub, S_sub) that show the widespread occurrence of subsurface scattering not only in desert regions but also in more humid climates with distinct dry seasons. These indicators offer a means to identify subsurface scattering effects, enabling users of H SAF ASCAT soil moisture data to mask such effects. By selecting one of the provided indicators and setting a suitable threshold, users can tailor the masking process to their specific needs. As a baseline, we recommend using the monthly subsurface scattering mask included here in its dedicated file.</p><p>We encourage the user community to leverage this data record to enhance the design of ASCAT soil moisture validation and application experiments. Moreover, this resource invites a reevaluation of conclusions drawn from earlier ASCAT studies and presents an opportunity to extend insights to other active microwave sensors operating at lower microwave frequencies (S-, L-, and P-band).</p><h2>Dataset Record</h2><h3>ASCAT Mask Results</h3><p>This file contains the a mask recommended for ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, designed to address various conditions that can render ASCAT soil moisture data unreliable. These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1. This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are excluded. Note that the subsurface scattering mask represents mean monthly conditions over the years 2007 to 2021, i.e. the behavior in single years may deviate from these conditions.</p><p>The interpretation of values is as follows:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied, signifying that the soil moisture retrieval is considered reliable</li><li>1: indicates the application of the mask, implying that the soil moisture retrieval may not be reliable</li></ul><h3>ERA5-Land Data Analysis</h3><p>For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of subsurface scattering or desiring to generate customized masks utilizing the provided indicators, this file offers insights into ASCAT backscatter and surface soil moisture in combination with ERA5-Land soil moisture as well as ancillary information.
