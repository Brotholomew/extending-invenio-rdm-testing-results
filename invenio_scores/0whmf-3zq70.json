These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1. This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, all ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are effectively excluded.</p><p>The interpretation of values is as follows:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied, signifying that the soil moisture retrieval is considered reliable</li><li>1: indicates the application of the mask, implying that the soil moisture retrieval may not be reliable</li></ul><h3>ERA5-Land Data Analysis</h3><p>For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of subsurface scattering or desiring to generate customized masks utilizing the provided indicators, this file offers insights into ASCAT backscatter and surface soil moisture in combination with ERA5-Land soil moisture as well as ancillary information.

This phenomenon has been discerned as the principal source of error in the current version of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, as it contradicts the prevalent assumption that soil backscatter should monotonically increase with soil moisture content. This happens because, in dry soil conditions, the presence of stones, rocks, or distinct soil layers can disrupt this expected relationship. At TU Wien, we have introduced one statistical (P_ano) and two physically based indicators (P_sub, S_sub) that illuminate the widespread occurrence of subsurface scattering not only in desert regions but also in more humid climates with distinct dry seasons. These indicators offer a means to identify subsurface scattering effects, enabling users of H SAF ASCAT soil moisture data to mask such effects. By selecting one of the provided indicators and setting a suitable threshold, users can tailor the masking process to their specific needs. As a baseline, we recommend using the monthly subsurface scattering mask included here in its dedicated file.</p><p>We encourage the user community to leverage this data record to enhance the design of ASCAT soil moisture validation and application experiments. Moreover, this resource invites a reevaluation of conclusions drawn from earlier ASCAT studies and presents an opportunity to extend insights to other active microwave sensors operating at lower microwave frequencies (S-, L-, and P-band).</p><p>The data record is intended to be accompanied by a dedicated paper scheduled for publication in the \"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing\" journal. Please be referred to this article for a theoretical discussion on error sources in ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, methods for detecting subsurface scattering, and the application of these methods through global-scale mapping.</p><h2>Dataset Record</h2><h3>ASCAT Mask Results</h3><p>This file contains the essential mask recommended for ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, designed to address various conditions that can render ASCAT soil moisture data unreliable. These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1. This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, all ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are effectively excluded.</p><p>The interpretation of values is as follows:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied, signifying that the soil moisture retrieval is considered reliable</li><li>1: indicates the application of the mask, implying that the soil moisture retrieval may not be reliable</li></ul><h3>ERA5-Land Data Analysis</h3><p>For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of subsurface scattering or desiring to generate customized masks utilizing the provided indicators, this file offers insights into ASCAT backscatter and surface soil moisture in combination with ERA5-Land soil moisture as well as ancillary information. The underlying data spans from 2007 to 2021 and is again gridded to the 12.5 km WARP5 grid.

These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1. This mask is applied to pixels that exceed this threshold for more than nine months. The results are gridded to the 12.5 km fixed Earth grid used for ASCAT (WARP5 grid).</p><p>By implementing this mask, all ASCAT pixels with potentially unreliable soil moisture measurements are effectively excluded.</p><p>The interpretation of values is as follows:</p><ul><li>0: indicates no mask is applied, signifying that the soil moisture retrieval is considered reliable</li><li>1: indicates the application of the mask, implying that the soil moisture retrieval may not be reliable</li></ul><h3>ERA5-Land Data Analysis</h3><p>For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of subsurface scattering or desiring to generate customized masks utilizing the provided indicators, this file offers insights into ASCAT backscatter and surface soil moisture in combination with ERA5-Land soil moisture as well as ancillary information.

These conditions encompass frozen soils, snow cover, wetlands, and areas with dense vegetation. Regarding the mitigation of subsurface scattering effects, the applied mask is derived from the monthly statistical indicator P_ano, with a threshold set at 0.1.

Open use is granted under the CC BY 4.0 license.\nThe provided dataset publication aims to mitigate the impacts of subsurface scattering on ASCAT soil moisture data as provided by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H SAF). This phenomenon has been discerned as the principal source of error in the current version of ASCAT soil moisture retrievals, as it contradicts the prevalent assumption that soil backscatter should monotonically increase with soil moisture content. This happens because, in dry soil conditions, the presence of stones, rocks, or distinct soil layers can disrupt this expected relationship. At TU Wien, we have introduced one statistical (P_ano) and two physically based indicators (P_sub, S_sub) that illuminate the widespread occurrence of subsurface scattering not only in desert regions but also in more humid climates with distinct dry seasons. These indicators offer a means to identify subsurface scattering effects, enabling users of H SAF ASCAT soil moisture data to mask such effects. By selecting one of the provided indicators and setting a suitable threshold, users can tailor the masking process to their specific needs. As a baseline, we recommend using the monthly subsurface scattering mask included here in its dedicated file.\nWe encourage the user community to leverage this data record to enhance the design of ASCAT soil moisture validation and application experiments.
